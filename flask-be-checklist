1) get simple API up and running (branch = set-up)
- pip install -r requirements.txt to install project requirements




TO DO:
- understand what each app.config variable does
- take all the config vars and put them in a .ENV file. Figure out how to do that in Python
- add DATE to the scores
- learn how to limit difficulty to just 1,2,3


MUST FIX:
- Get full functionality working
- write the Read.ME
- integrate date-time & sorting by best score
- integrate with Postgres
- fix username inputs into the DB. Make sure there are no leading/trailing white spaces, not case sensitive etc.
- make resulting outputs pretty
- clean up the file, break things up into smaller functions etc. (can do after READ.ME)
- Add unit tests


BE READY TO BUILD THE FOLLOWING IN INTERVIEW:
- add user login

CONTINUE BUILDING ON THE PROJECT ON A SEPERATE BRANCH - STAGING. 


cleanup ideas: 
- input text file
- base URL

Other questions you should know answers to:
- Systems Design etc.
- JSON - why do we use it?
- HTTP protocol
- WHY did I use Rest API? What is it good for?
